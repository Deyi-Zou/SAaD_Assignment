When finish our own job, I mean the .docx file, we can push them to this repo too, I think it's handy too update the files and for others to check.

## From Deyi:
Some thoughts:
1. There are 6 subsystems to be analyzed in "Requirement Summary" section, we can split them, each person 2 subsystems.  
But I'm not sure about the "Project Summary" and "Future Considerations section" section, we can discuss later.  

2. Maybe printing the Materials (The two pdf of GIORP-5000)  is a good choice.   
We could develop our own notes on it, since, as the professor mentioned, we need to read it again and again.  
We have free printing points anyway :)

3. English is my second language, and I’m still struggling with it.  
Whenever you feel vague about what I’m saying, please do feel free to tell me 😅 , it can improve me too.
